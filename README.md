# tapIn
Tap-In is a mental health wellness application that allows its users to track their mood, goals, and overall well-being through a fully customizable and easy to use user interface. Users create a free profile and are given a variety of choices regarding what they want to track, how frequently they want to "tap-in", and what type of feedback they'd like, if any. The app generates reports, visualizaitons, and graphics based on the users custom inputs - this allows users to easily track their progress and tap into what may be causing their ups and downs.

This idea was inspired by a very rudimentary version that I built for myself at the encouragement of my therapist, who practices CBT as well as other therapeutic modalities. It began as an excel spreadsheet that worked as a "scorecard", but that became difficult to keep up with, so its current iteration is a simple note on my iPhone. This is why it's so important for tap-in to be fully customizable, rather than forcing its users into a rigid strucutre of what it means to check, or tap, in.
